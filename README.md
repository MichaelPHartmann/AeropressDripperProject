# Aeropress Dripper Project

### A simple prototype for turning the popular aeropress into a no-bypass percolation dripper.

This idea actually started with a plastic cup with holes drilled in the bottom. The resultant coffee was good, but needed some tweaking. By iterating on this design using 3D Printing I can test out different shower head combinations and multistage shower heads, as well as head pressure to find an optimal setup.

While most percolation brewers have some level of water bypass (Hario V60, Kalita Wave), the Aeropress forces all the water through one bed of coffee, thereby increasing potential extraction. because it is important to limit channeling and differing thicknesses of the bed, a spray head must be used to gently and evenly saturate the grounds.

The brewing volume of the Aeropress in this configuration is less than 300mL, and the drip through time is substantially longer than a standard dripper. The general recipe used so far in testing has been 22g water to 1 gram of ground coffee. Testing with 12g of ground coffee and 265g of water has shown to be about the upper limit of the brewer if the water is added in a single pour. The coffee is ground very finely, but unfortunately no easy way to objectively convey grind size exists to my knowledge.
